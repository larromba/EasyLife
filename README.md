## How it works
There are 3 sections in the todo list:
* Missed... - all items missed before today. missed items require attention to be rescheduled
* Today - all items for today
* Later - all items for a date after today. no stress

Todo items can recur, meaning they re-appear every x days. 

Todo items can be given a project. If a todo item is attached to a project, it appears higher in the list for the day it's scheduled, depending on the priority of the project

Marking recurring items as done moves them to a later date. Marking normal items as done moves them to the archive. Items can be undone in the archive view.

Todo items can block the progress of other todo items. Any blocking items must first be marked as done before the topmost item can be marked as done.

If a recurring item has been missed, rather than changing the recurring date, the item can be split, which creates a copy to be rescheduled, and automatically reschedules the original item at the next available recurring date.
